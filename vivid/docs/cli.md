# CLI

The CLI is intended as an easily accessible user interface that supports most, if not all, operations possible with vivid classes.

## Usage

Run the CLI using `python3 -m vivid.cli` in the root directory in an activated virtual environment. The CLI uses or creates `/vivid/imagedb.db` for the database file.

## Possible uses

- Custom SQL statements.

- Modifying records not possible with vivid_GUI, such as renaming tags.

- Utilizing methods in the vivid module not available with vivid_GUI.

- Testing and debugging.

- Modifying the database if unwanted changes occur.
